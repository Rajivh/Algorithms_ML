Algorithm for training a Neural Network for XOR logic gate computation. Has two input nodes, one hidden layer of 3 nodes and one output node.

XOR gate outputs 1 for Input of (0,1) and (1,0) and outputs 0 for Input of (1,1) and (0,0). 
It is NOT(X1 AND X2) AND (X1 OR X2) - where X1 and X2 are the two inputs.
